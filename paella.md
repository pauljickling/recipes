# Paella Mixto

## Ingredients

- 30 threads saffron, crushed (a scant 1/2 tsp.)    
- proteins such as fish, chicken, calamari
- 10 large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- half cup olive oil
- 4 oz. chorizo
- 1 tbsp. smoked paprika
- 3 cloves of minced garlic
- 3 bay leaves
- 3 diced tomatoes
- 1 minced onion
- 7 cups of stock
- 2.5 cups of bomba rice
- peas
- roasted red peppers in 1/2" strips
- 12 mussels

## Instructions

Put saffron and quarter cup hot water in a small bowl; let sit for 15 minutes. Season proteins with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a paella pan over medium-high heat. Add proteins and cook, turning occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer shrimp, and any other fast cooking item to a plate. Add paprika, garlic, bay leaves, tomatoes, and onions to pan and cook, stirring often, until onions soften, about 6 minutes. Add reserved saffron mixture and broth, season with salt, and bring to a boil over high heat.

Sprinkle in rice, distribute evenly with a spoon, and add peas, and peppers. Cook, without stirring, until rice has absorbed most of the liquid, 10–12 minutes. (If your pan is larger than the burner, rotate it every two minutes so different parts are over the heat and the rice cooks evenly.) Reduce heat to low, add reserved shrimp, and nestle in mussels hinge side down; cook, without stirring, until mussels have opened and rice has absorbed the liquid and is al dente, 5–10 minutes more. Remove pan from heat, and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
